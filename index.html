    <p>
      I studied chemistry, then majored <em>BIT Computer and Networking</em> and became a Technical Support Specialist... and now re-trying out coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 10 years old, I decided to build my own web graphics to create "cute" designs for a game called <em>NeoPets</em>(disconninuted).
      During this time, I was introduced into Anime and thought, why not make an Anime graphics website where I can make website designs for free.
      I self taught myself HTML/CSS, thanks to <em>HTML for dummies</em>, and
      learned how to use Photoshp, thanks to my family member who works as a graphic designer.
    </p>
    <p>
      During highschool, my asian parents really wanted me to become a either a doctor, nurse, or a lawyer, and decided to major in Chemistry.
      I was doing great until I realized how much I disliked being in a labatory, getting burns with chemicals every other day, and thought,
      why not try going into some sort of computer program or purhaps an IT career.
    </p>
    <p>
      I completed my Bachelors of IT and currently working in my career field.
      I like meeting new people and assist people to non tech-savy people.
      But... I feel like I was still missing that outsource of creativity...
      If I can go back in time, and If I knew UX/UI or frontend developer was a career choice, I would've easily made this decision 10 years ago.
